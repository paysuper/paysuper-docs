## PaySuper
PaySuper is a payment service with [an open source multifunctional toolkit](https://github.com/paysuper) that provides secure and immediate online payment transactions for the games industry.

Our mission is to maximize profits for developers, publishers, and platforms. We’re focused on keeping conversion rates high and costs low – including those related to integration and maintenance.

## PaySuper JS SDK
[PaySuper’s JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/paysuper/paysuper-js-sdk) is designed to integrate a PaySuper Payment Form on your website.

## PaySuper API
[PaySuper public REST API server](https://github.com/paysuper/paysuper-management-api) is used for a payment form and dashboards.

[PaySuper API](/api-reference/api-swagger/) is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. The PaySuper API is organized around REST. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.
