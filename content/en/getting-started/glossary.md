## PaySuper
PaySuper is a payment service with [an open source multifunctional toolkit](https://github.com/paysuper) that provides secure and immediate online payment transactions for the games industry.

Our mission is to maximize profits for developers, publishers, and platforms. We’re focused on keeping conversion rates high and costs low – including those related to integration and maintenance.

## PaySuper JS SDK
[PaySuper’s JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/paysuper/paysuper-js-sdk) is designed to integrate a PaySuper Payment Form on your website.

## PaySuper API
[PaySuper public REST API server](https://github.com/paysuper/paysuper-management-api) is used for a payment form and dashboards.

[PaySuper API](/api-reference/api-swagger/) is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. The PaySuper API is organized around REST. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.

## Order

## Simple checkout
This sales option is best suited for a quick integration for payment orders with dynamical pricing, for example, stores that use its e-commerce engine for product management. Likewise, this option is more appropriate for non-products payments such as donations and others. In this mode, you specify the currency and price, and the payment amount for the end-user will be calculated according to its exchange rate if it differs from the specified order currency.

## Payment Form
The payment form implements a complete functionality for user interaction during the payment process.

* Displays a complete order information for the user
* Collects data about the selected payment method
* Collects user account data
* Displays a purchase status

## Virtual Currency
Virtual Currency is an option to sell your in-game currency — gold, coins, etc. It allows you to sell customisable quantity of your currency. The built in webhook testing is an obligatory requirement for this sales option.

## Game Keys
