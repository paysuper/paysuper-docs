PaySuper payment solution can be either used in combination with other Protocol One components, or integrated into any third-party storefront or web page that must accept payments. 

PaySuper is an SaaS solution operated by Protocol One. A similar payment solution can be deployed on your own servers or in the cloud using the PaySuper open source code. 

## To get started

+ You need to register on the PaySuper website.
+ Go through the KYC procedure and sign a contract (you can use an e-signature).
+ Set up a project and perform technical integration on the side of your website or service. 

This will be enough to provide end users with a way to pay for games and other digital products. 

{{% warning %}}
PaySuper payouts are made on a weekly basis. In most cases, the first money will be transferred to your current account within 7 days after signing the contract and accepting the first payment.
