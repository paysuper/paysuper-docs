PaySuper is a payment system with an [open source code](https://github.com/paysuper). It accepts end-user payments, provides reports, analysis and direct access to payment data, and handles payouts.

Pay One has built-in tools for in-depth integration with other elements of the Protocol One ecosystem. 

### Integration with Other Elements of Protocol One

#### [Uttu](https://drive.google.com/a/protocol.one/open?id=1DexhXSLhbd3tFXDjP8WV4KqcKnv8PXe8mDgJuMOwVLI) 

For a more extensive analysis of user actions on the payment form and building end-to-end funnels, you can connect Uttu analytics tools to the website. Connecting Uttu to Pay One forms is done with just a few clicks. With Uttu, you can also manage ad targeting. 

#### [Qilin](https://drive.google.com/a/protocol.one/open?id=1DexhXSLhbd3tFXDjP8WV4KqcKnv8PXe8mDgJuMOwVLI)

If you use Qilin, it can be closely integrated with Pay One. Pay One is able to receive information about products, prices, and discounts (including personal ones) from Qilin. A key stream can be connected to the product. 

#### [Storefront constructor](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SZ3mRkxXHdtksR9vXu5pkqKYnEzkPh2PUqz1TOj94SY/edit)

Using the Storefront constructor, you can connect the Pay One payment form as a plugin. Pay One landing pages and payment form are optimized for collaboration. 

#### [Auth One](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18XPvGjEuPSjFO1S4QJEtylyWUDZoMAbHXYDamHYqK3U/edit?usp=sharing)

With the User Accounts Protocol One module, you can configure single sign-on authentication for your users in the payment form without writing code.
