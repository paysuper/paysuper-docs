Steps of the accepting a payment process:

![PaySuper accepting payment](/accepting-payment.png)

## Interaction with the payment interface

* The user begins their interaction with the payment form by clicking on an interface element on the website. The form is displayed in accordance with regional features and project settings. 
* The form responds to user actions with minimal user interface delays. 
* In the interface, the user selects a payment method (when possible), enters plastic card information or credentials for another means of payment, passes KYC elements if necessary or fills in data required for product delivery (for example, an email or instant messenger contact to receive the key). 

## Payment confirmation

When all the required fields in the interface are filled, the user confirms the payment and acceptance of its terms. 

## Payment status display

The form informs on the current status of the payment. 

In addition, PaySuper has implemented client alerts about the transaction stages, and you can implement display logic for processing them on your website. 

## Successful payment notification

After each payment, the user receives a notification containing the transaction details and, if necessary, a key or link for using the digital product. By default, this notification is sent to the email address specified by the user (or passed on by you). 

The notification can also be sent to one of the instant messengers.
