Our API is designed to have predictable, resource-oriented URLs and to use HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. The PaySuper API is organized around REST. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP verbs, which can be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.

JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors.
