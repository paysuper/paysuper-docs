##  Check notification request

The PaySuper API uses secret keys to check notification requests. 

{{% warning %}}
Your secret keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
{{% /warning %}}

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

#### To check the digital signatures you should: 

1. Concatenate the request's JSON body with your project's secret key. The secret key should be added to end of JSON body.
2. Apply SHA-256 hashing to the resulting string. 
3. Compare the digital signatures with Authorization http header value.
