We do not identify them based solely on IP. We recognize a USA user who came to Germany and opened the payment interface there, so as not to make the mistake of showing them the form in German and with German payment methods. 

Most of the project settings can be configured separately for each region or language: 

* The list of available payment methods and their order in the payment form. 

* The design and order of payment form screens.

* The assortment of available products.

* Prices on products.

* All text attributes and images of products.
