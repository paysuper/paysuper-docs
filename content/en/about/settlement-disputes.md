The rules for handling such situations differ depending on the **payment method** and **territory**. 

> In all cases, PaySuper consistently notifies you via the API and in your account.

As a rule, you have about 30 days to dispute a chargeback on a specific transaction by providing proof that the buyer has received the product. PaySuper controls the timings and takes on the transfer of your proof to a specific payment operator. 

You will be able to perform all the necessary actions for this in your PaySuper account.
