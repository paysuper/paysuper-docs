A return of funds can be initiated not only by you (refund), but also on the side of the payment method, for example, at the userâ€™s request to the card-issuing bank (chargeback). 

The rules for handling such situations differ depending on the **payment method** and **territory**. 

> In all cases, Pay One consistently notifies you via the API and in your account.

As a rule, you have about 30 days to dispute a chargeback on a specific transaction by providing proof that the buyer has received the product. Pay One controls the timings and takes on the transfer of your proof to a specific payment operator. 

You will be able to perform all the necessary actions for this in your Pay One account.
