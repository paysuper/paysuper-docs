Pay One is an open source service for accepting payments, which includes: a flexibly
customizable payment form, a set of integration protocols, a management interface, and
statistics tools.

## What does PaySuper do?

Our mission is to give developers, publishers, platforms and stores an opportunity to accept
payments with minimal losses and costs due to high conversion, low commission and
minimization of labor costs related to integration and maintenance.

Our solution is a part of Protocol One IaaS, it is actively used in [Storefront constructor](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SZ3mRkxXHdtksR9vXu5pkqKYnEzkPh2PUqz1TOj94SY/edit). Pay One
can be installed as a component on a Protocol One-independent system, employing its own
hardware or cloud platform.
