When Pay One has enough data to communicate with the user and it is not prohibited by local laws, the user is prompted to finish the transaction: via email, a push-notification or instant messenger. 

If integrated with [Uttu](https://drive.google.com/a/protocol.one/open?id=1DexhXSLhbd3tFXDjP8WV4KqcKnv8PXe8mDgJuMOwVLI), you can also set up a channel for delivering such notifications through banners or other ad placements.

This approach allows you to return about **5%** of users who have not completed the payment.
