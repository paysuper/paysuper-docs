Anyone can use the [PaySuper toolkit](https://github.com/paysuper) to create their own payment solution. 

This will require you to:

* Download and deploy the necessary PaySuper elements in your infrastructure.
* Sign a contract for accepting payments with a bank (or banks).
* Pass [PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss) certification.

Open source allows us to implement best practices developed by the community in our SaaS-solution in the shortest possible time. The best versions of customized forms, which take into account the specifics of use and legislation in different regions, are constantly added to the PaySuper payment form template library.
