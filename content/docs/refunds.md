# Refunding payments
***

You can request to refund a charge in whole for a processed transaction. After requesting a refund it cannot be cancelled. PaySuper automatically sends email receipt to your customers whenever they have a refunded purchase.

{{< hint warning >}}
The refund can be sent only to the same customer's bank card was used in a payment. If the customer's card is expired, the refund will be made to the reissued card.

## Issuing a refund

1. Search the payment in the [Transactions](https://paysupermgmt.tst.protocol.one/transactions) page.
2. Click the **Request to refund** icon to the right of the Amount column.
