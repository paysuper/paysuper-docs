# Analytics Integration

It's assumed that you have already integrated [PaySuper Checkout via SDK](/docs/payments/sdk-integration) and have set up your Google Analytics account.

## Integrate

We've set up a Google Analytics data collection in a test mode inside PaySuper. After the Beta testing, we'll release the analytics integration to use with a customer's tracking ID.
