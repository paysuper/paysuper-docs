## Getting Started

To get started with PaySuper, choose your business model:

- **[Simple Checkout](/docs/payments/simple)**

    This sales option is best suited for a quick integration for payment orders with dynamical pricing, for example, stores that use its e-commerce engine for product management. Likewise, this option is more appropriate for non-products payments such as donations and others. In this mode, you specify the currency and price, and the payment amount for the end-user will be calculated according to its exchange rate if it differs from the specified order currency.
- **[Keys Checkout](/docs/payments/keys)**

    With this option you can conveniently sell game keys for various DRM platforms, products (such as games), in-game items and virtual currency. It assumes you have added a Project and Product in PaySuper Admin with all applicable information. This feature allows you to sell any key activated products such as DLC, expansion packs, etc. which are supported by DRM platforms: Steam, GOG, Uplay, Origin, PSN, XBOX Store, Nintendo Store, Itch.io, Epic Games Store.
