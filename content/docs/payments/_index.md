## Getting Started

To get started with PaySuper, choose your business model:

- **[Simple Checkout](/docs/payments/simple)**

    This sales option is best suited for a quick integration for payment orders with dynamical pricing, for example, stores that use its e-commerce engine for product management. Likewise, this option is more appropriate for non-products payments such as donations and others. In this mode, you specify the currency and price, and the payment amount for the end-user will be calculated according to its exchange rate if it differs from the specified order currency.
- **[Keys Checkout](/docs/payments/keys)**

    With this option you can conveniently sell game keys for various DRM platforms, products (such as games), in-game items and virtual currency. It assumes you have added a Project and Product in PaySuper Admin with all applicable information.
