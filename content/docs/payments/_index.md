## Getting Started

To get started with PaySuper, choose your business model:

### [Simple Checkout](/docs/payments/simple)

Simple Checkout is designed for payment orders with dynamical pricing, for example, stores that use its e-commerce engine for product management. Likewise, this option works well with non-product payments such as donations. In this mode, you specify the currency and the price, while the payment amount due for the end-user is calculated accordingly to the exchange rate if it differs from the specified order currency.

### [Typed Checkout](/docs/payments/keys)

PaySuper Checkout provides several types of products which you specify in an order as a parameter `type`:

**Game Keys**

This sales option is best suited to sale game keys for DRM platforms such as Steam, GOG, Uplay, Origin, PSN, XBOX Store, Nintendo Store, Itch.io, Epic Games Store. This feature allows you to sell any key-activated products (such as DLCs and expansion packs) that the target DRM platforms support.

**Virtual Items**

This sales option enables you to sell your Virtual Items, like swords, guns, helmets and virtual currency packs.

**Virtual Currency**

Virtual Currency is an option to sell your in-game currency — gold, coins, etc. It allows you to sell customisable quantity of your currency.
