## **Step 4.** Set up a Checkout Form

Use Checkout to collect [one-time payments](/docs/payments/#simple-checkout) or to sell [products defined in the Project](/docs/payments/#products-checkout).

### [Payment initialization with token](/docs/payments/token/)

You can encrypt details of your customer (such as the user ID, email and others), a game and purchase parameters. When your customer wants to pay for something you redirect them to the Unlimint Game Services-hosted Checkout Form to instantly complete a purchase.

### [Server-side payment initialization](/docs/payments/integration/)

You can also integrate on a server-side without Unlimint Game Services SJ SDK for other reasons. Checkout Form can be embedded as an iframe or new window.

### [Client-side payment initialization](/docs/payments/sdk-integration/)

The client-side payment initialization lets you accept online payments using only frontend code Unlimint Game Services JS SDK. The Checkout Form can be embedded as an iframe or modal window.

## **Step 4.** After the payment

You can use webhooks or the Transaction log to accomplish the purchase. More details about handling the purchase fulfilment with Unlimint Game Services Checkout are available at [After the payment](/docs/payments/fulfillment/).
