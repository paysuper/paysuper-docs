## **Step 3.** Set up a Checkout Form

Use Checkout to collect [one-time payments](/docs/payments/#simple-checkout) or to sell [products defined in the Project](/docs/payments/#typed-checkout).

### [Client-side payment initialization](/docs/payments/sdk-integration/)

The client-side payment initialization lets you accept online payments using only frontend code PaySuper JS SDK. The Checkout Form can be embedded as an [iframe](ССЫЛКА на метод renderPage) or [modal window](ССЫЛКА на метод renderModal).

### [Server-side payment initialization](/docs/payments/integration/)

You can also integrate on a server-side without PaySuper SJ SDK for other reasons. Checkout Form can be embedded as an [iframe](ССЫЛКА) or [new window](ССЫЛКА).

### [Payment initialization with token](/docs/payments/token/)

You can encrypt details of your customer (such as the user ID, email and others), a game and purchase parameters. When your customer wants to pay for something you redirect them to the PaySuper-hosted Checkout Form to instantly complete a purchase.

## **Step 4.** After the payment

You can use [webhooks](ССЫЛКА) or the [Transaction log](ССЫЛКА) to accomplish the purchase. More details about handling the purchase fulfilment with PaySuper Checkout are available at [After the payment](/docs/payments/fulfillment/).
