Our KYC procedure is nice and short: we ask you to fill-in the essential information about your company, your bank, to set up payment methods and to sign the license agreement. PaySuper Admin offers a step-by-step guide.

PaySuper Admin is also the place to set up all your Projects and Products before you can sell them. You can fill the description in the languages that are important to you along with prices across multiple currencies.

As you fill in all the relevant information, we'll generate Project and Product IDs that you'll use in PaySuper Checkout.
